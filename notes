mean free path : distance partical can travel before it collides with another particle
    ie aerosol spray doesn't go forever
effusion gas escaping from small hole into vacuum
difusion gas intersperse into eachother


open system transfer mater and enrgy,                                             closed only energy
coffee, can smell with molecule transfer and feel radiating heat                   closed bottle that sun's heat can get in but liquid can get out and nothing in




isolated
isolated system, nothing in or out between the environment and the system,
         think what thermos tries to do when closed,
         wont loose heat (if perfect)



    work can be manifested as flow of electrons,
    expansion of gas (i.e. pushing a piston)
    

    chemical potential is relative positions of tiny particles (electro static)
    change in ways to lower potential energy, but needs activation energy  like pushing a ball resting on the top of a hill

    total internal energy is the symbol U

    thermal plus potential

    heat and work are transferse, none of it in a system
    heat=mass*specificheat*temp changes
    temp change= final heat - initial heat
